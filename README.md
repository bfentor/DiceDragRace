## Purpose
A fun way to show the difference in speed between a couple of popular languages. I had to write a bash script for a university course which simulated throwing dice. I, as anyone would apon completing such a project, tried some absurdly large number, and was happy to see that it performed fairly well, but I did wonder how much faster it could be if done with a compiled language. 
    Filled with inspiration, I took all my programming knowledge and decided to remake the program in 2 compiled languages, and a significantly faster interpreted language. I wrote a bash script so that you can easily run every program one after the other and see the results on your own machine.

# Instructions
Launch `race.sh` to run the test and see the results, or launch each program individually to see some numbers if that's your thing
